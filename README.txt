A bunch of balls under the simulated influences of gravity and kinetic collisions, hope you enjoy!

Left Click: creates a planet, hold down to increase planet radius and mass
Right Click: creates an unmovable planet
Mouse Drag: while the mouse is held down, this will apply an initial velocity to the planet

Arrow Keys: increase/decrease gravity factor
Backspace: delete last created planet
Escape: delete all planets

This project was a fun exercise in linear algebra and physics. I finally got to apply some of the vector maths I was learning in lecture and theres always something satisfying about seeing the principles in action. Definitely the hardest part of this project was handling planet collisions and bounce angles off planets. I ended up taking the velocity vectors of the planets, rotating the plane, and then calculating the new vectors based on a 2d linear collision. All in all this was a pretty short and small project I enjoyed.
